Are you tired of receiving spam emails and calls? Do you wish there was an easy and efficient way to check if a phone number or email address is legitimate or not? Look no further! With my program, you can easily input suspicious phone numbers or email addresses and receive instant feedback on whether it's spam or not. But that's not all - behind the scenes, the app is utilizing an API key to check an external database and return a positive or negative result. And for those who need a little extra help, there's a comprehensive list of frequently asked questions and a user-friendly guide. Plus, as an added bonus, users can even export their findings to a convenient PDF. Say goodbye to spam once and for all with my innovative and easy-to-use program.
